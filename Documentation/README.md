## Creating your first script

1. **Launch Your IDE**\
   Start by opening your preferred integrated development environment (IDE). We recommend [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for the best experience, but any editor that supports Lua will work.
2. **Navigate to the Lua script location** `Impulse -> Game -> Lua`\
   Locate and open the `main.lua` file. This is the main script file that the engine runs after the dependencies, core, libraries, and modules are loaded.
3. **Start Writing Your Script**\
   Begin writing your Lua script inside `main.lua`. If you're not sure where to start, you can try one of the [example scripts](examples/) provided in the documentation or sample projects—they’re a great way to learn how scripting works in Impulse.
4. **Save and Run**\
   Once your script is ready, save the file. Because of how Impulse is designed, you need to restart the application to see the changes in effect, **this may change sometime soon**.

{% hint style="info" %}
A [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extension is currently in development that will allow you to run and manage your Impulse application directly from within VS Code—making testing and debugging much easier.
